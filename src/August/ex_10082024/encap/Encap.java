/*
    ## Encapsulation
- Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP).
- Bundling of **data and methods** that operate on that data within a single unit.
- Data members should be private in nature.
- Methods with getter and setter only, you can access the data members / attributes.
- Getter and Setter - help you to get or set the value via the methods only, not with the reference.
- `// Use Setter and Getter with Condition to secure your data members by methods`
- Getter -> Fetch the data member - secure this also
- Setter - Update the value -> secure this also (based on the condition)
- Web Automation - Page Class
- API Automaton - Pojo Class
- Advantage of Encapsulation
- **Data Hiding**
- **Increased Flexibility**: You can make the variables of the class read-only or write-only depending on your requirements.
- Security.
